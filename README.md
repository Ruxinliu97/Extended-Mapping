# Extended-Mapping

Here is the link of the shiny app: https://lrx-97.shinyapps.io/Extended_mapping/

The presentation slide is available in both rmd and HTML files.

The report slide is available in rmd, pdf and HTML files. However, the plotly map is not supported by pdf, please check the rmd or HTML for the interactive map.

If any of the HTML files are not working, you could try knit the rmd file to see the result. Thank you :)
